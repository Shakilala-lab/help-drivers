# DriveLog Lite

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

**Important:** This project is built using Next.js, which is a Javascript Framework, and cannot be directly migrated to Android Studio, which builds native Android apps with Java or Kotlin.

To create an installable Android application that stores data in Google Sheets, you'll need to create a new Android project using Android Studio. You can then connect to the Google Sheets API for Android using Java or Kotlin. This requires significant code rewrite and different architectural decisions.

This app helps drivers to send data to Google sheets.
