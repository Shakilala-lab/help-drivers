## Original User Request:
You need to create an application in java. The main page should welcome the user and invite them to register. To register, just enter your username and password. The user information will need to be saved to a Google tablet, creating a separate row for it. Next, the user will need to fill in five columns 1. "Mileage on the odometer?" 2. "The time of the medic's mark in the travel list." 3. "The time at which the tachograph card was inserted." Next, all this data needs to be placed in a Google tablet for this user.
